# barcodeReader
Program which reads barcodes that are in the form of screenshot's taken from the web.
--Later in the program, I employed a simple one-dimensional clustering algorithm in order to more effectively and accurately read and interpret the stripes of the barcode.


7/20/2021: I have gotten the program to read most barcodes on the left-hand side for right now, I next need to get my program to work for the part of the barcode on the right-hand side of the middle guard.
